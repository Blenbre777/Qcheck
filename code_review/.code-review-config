# Path Resolution Notes
# =============================================================================
# All paths in this configuration are relative to the project root directory.
# The scripts automatically detect the project root and resolve paths accordingly.
# This allows execution from any directory within the project.
#
# Examples:
# - Running from /Qcheck/: paths work as-is
# - Running from /Qcheck/back/: paths are resolved relative to /Qcheck/
# - Running from /Qcheck/code_review/: paths are resolved relative to /Qcheck/
